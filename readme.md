## Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games - Section 3

### Game Design Document (GDD)

#### Concept

- The core concept is simple: escape room

- You awaken in a locked room, unable to escape

- Use environmental clues such as light and sound to determine what to do next

- Trigger preassure plates and solve puzzles to progress towards the exit.

#### Rules

- No lose condition, apart from the feeling you’re going to die in this room if you don’t get out!

- Anything that you can do, you are allowed to do

- You win by finally exiting the room.

#### Requirements

- Unreal’s provided Starter Content pack

- C++ code and Blueprint to encode behaviour

- Various sound effects to enhance atmosphere

- Sketches for layout of room(s)

- Sketches for how puzzles work.
